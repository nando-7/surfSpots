# surfSpots


Final project for the ‘Web Developer Bootcamp Course’. Using all the frontend and backend languages taught in the course it was time to put it all into practice and the result is a web app that was built using the RESTful routes structure that allows the user to create an account to post his favourites surf spots and comment in other people’s spots. This web app uses Bootstrap for styling, NodeJs for the backend, ExpressJS as the frontend library, Google Maps API for displaying the spots locations and MongoDB as the data base for the users and surf spots and comments added.
